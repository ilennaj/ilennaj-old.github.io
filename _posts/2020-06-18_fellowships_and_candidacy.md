June 15th 2020 I learned that I was awarded the [2020 Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Gilliam Graduate Fellowship](https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/g20_announcement_091219.pdf) grant. News of the award both revived and resolved some complex emotions. I take the time now to reflect on the year leading up to applying to this fellowship for the second time, and figure out how in the world I might have deserved this award (since, apparently, I do deserve it). At the end of this blog post, I have some takeaways for the graduate student beginning to think about fellowship applications and starting to face one of the largest challenges of graduate school: The Candidacy (prelim) Exam. I hope students and advisors alike will find this post useful when thinking about what the process might be like for them or their students.

**Beginning to Reflect**

In 2014, a junior in college, I attended the HHMI Exceptional Research Opportunities Program ([EXROP](https://www.hhmi.org/node/18676/devel#)) orientation. This was one of those reality-bending, fortune-augmenting moments that seemed to really change the course of my life. I remember sitting in an auditorium, learning about Howard Hughes, HHMI, and the purpose of the money Howard Hughes left. Then I learned about this fellowship. It sounded so regal: The Gilliam Fellowship. As someone who looked for goals to commit to, I knew I wanted it as soon as I heard about it. That last year, only about 7 or 9 people, I can’t remember, were awarded it and it seemed really prestigious. I wanted to be one of those people. Funny enough, looking back I appreciated my single-minded enthusiasm in reaching my goals, however I never thought, like I do now, that those goals were a little bit short sighted. Not to say they were bad goals! It’s just that now I don’t (truly) know what I want to do with my PhD. I have an idea of my choices, but my goals only reach as far as the end of the PhD. But anyway, here I am, ending my 3rd year of my PhD with the prestigious accolade I set my eyes on 6 years ago. Perhaps it’s a sign to fully commit to a long career in science. Seems like I’d be good at it. It feels good to get this - but the main feeling I have is relief.

You see when you enter into graduate school, you don’t realize it, but you are stepping out of a world with near-instant, quantitative, grades-driven feedback and into a world where you are your own evaluator. Yes, you do get graded in your 2 years of graduate courses and if you are fortunate enough to excel at those, good for you. Graduate courses overall kicked my butt. And yes, you have an advisor who gives you feedback, but if you’re like me, suffering from [imposter syndrome](https://www.ascb.org/careers/frauds-managing-imposter-syndrome-grad-school/) despite your best interests, believing positive feedback is incredibly hard when it isn’t in the form of a letter grade. That’s an unfortunate result of our education system as it is now, but I won’t go off in that direction, I wanted to talk about the path to this award. 

I felt relief because it was positive feedback in its most concrete form - money and prestige. Someone (many someones) evaluated my work and decided to give me money and prestige for it. That doesn’t happen often in graduate school, but when it does, it gives you so much validation, quenches the thirst for affirmation that even though you feel lost you’re still generally going in the right direction. I needed this. And this makes it easier to believe my candidacy exam committee, my mentors, my advisor, and everyone else when they say I’m doing a good job. I didn’t believe it until now. 

I’m also a bit sad. Sad because I’ve struggled so hard to perform and question and read and write, all while being convinced that I’d be discovered and weeded out as an imposter. I feel like I shouldn’t have had to feel this way. It makes me wonder why I rely so much on external validation. But it makes sense that I do - I’ve been so trained to respond to external validation throughout all of my science education (kind words, letter grades, awards), that I rarely find within myself a kind of internal validation when I look at my own work and see a job well done.

But I digress.

**Attempt Number One: First Gilliam Fellowship Submission**

After leaving HHMI campus and going to Stanford for my HHMI EXROP experience, I fast forward to the middle of my 2nd year at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a Neuroscience PhD, December 2018. I was terrified. Overwhelmed. And this was even while I was in a nurturing lab environment with supportive friends and a well-functioning graduate program. I felt these things because I had to begin preparing for the biggest exam of my life: the candidacy exam, aka prelims. The format of prelims was to prepare a document that followed the same guidelines as the [National Research Service Award (NRSA)](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/training-grants/T32) application, and give a presentation on that document. The content of the document was a plan for your entire thesis - what your big question is, what experiments you were going to do, and justifications for every single thing you propose. We had until May to prepare and I didn’t believe I could do it. I hatched a plan - I would push myself to try to make a proposal for the Gilliam Fellowship, due in January. I didn’t really believe I would be able to make something that would win, but it soothed my nerves because at the very least I had to make something presentable. So I talked with my advisor and a postdoc in my lab and came up with a general proposal plan.

I see now that the second hardest part about writing the proposal was that I did not really know how to write something if I could only understand two thirds of it. I talked about the plan over and over with my advisor and the postdoc on my lab in order to uncover the parts I did not understand. And when I felt like I got most of it, I had to then write it. This was the hardest part. The best test of whether or not you understand something is to communicate it well. For that I read my advisor’s [10 Simple Rules for Structuring Papers](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) and tried my best. What helped my writing the most was bringing my writing to my advisor, sitting down next to him, and rewriting/editing the document while my advisor explained why he changed what he changed. It was emotionally difficult to do paired writing at first because I had to watch as the words I proudly crafted and put to paper were being rewritten, better, before my eyes. But I realized early on to acknowledge my ego, let it say its piece in defense of my writing ability, and then let it pass on by so I could focus on why the words replacing my own not only made sense but were more compelling. I credit those paired writing sessions, coupled with my attitude adjustment, for my ability to write scientific prose as well as I do now. When it was time to submit my proposal to Gilliam the first time, I submitted something I was proud of. Now, 1.5 years later I know I can do much better.

**Preparing for the Exam**

After I submitted my Gilliam submission in January, I had to immediately forget about the fellowship and try to improve on the proposal I had written. As I read more papers and sat down to write my thoughts on the ideas I already put to paper, I realized my ideas were either unoriginal, or logically flawed. This became a disheartening theme. It’s rather daunting to realize that you are trying your best to contribute to a field that already has hundreds, if not thousands of people roving over the literature and finding holes to fill. I found that I had a lot of difficulty reading papers and got discouraged a lot. I put off working on it and focused on my classes. 1.5 months went by and on March 1st, it finally hit me that I only had a little more than 80 days left. That’s when I got serious, and felt a touch of low-level, ever-present panic. The prelim was a crisis that crept ever-nearer and I had to be ready.

That’s when I started doing what kept me going all the way up to the exam date. I started a daily journal, called “processing”, where I kept track of my “processes” throughout the day. I narrated my actions. Here’s an example beginning entry in March:


    20190311-processing

    Had meeting with Konrad about my CAJAL application and the significance document. I liked the meeting.

    The larger structure of the significance should be:

    Identification of questions
      The Existence Problem
      The Inverse Problem
      The Learning Problem

    Etc.
