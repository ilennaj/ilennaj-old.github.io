June 15th 2020 I learned that I was awarded the [2020 Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Gilliam Graduate Fellowship](https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/g20_announcement_091219.pdf) grant. News of the award both revived and resolved some complex emotions. I take the time now to reflect on the year leading up to applying to this fellowship for the second time, and figure out how in the world I might have deserved this award (since, apparently, I do deserve it). At the end of this blog post, I have some takeaways for the graduate student beginning to think about fellowship applications and starting to face one of the largest challenges of graduate school: The Candidacy (prelim) Exam. I hope students and advisors alike will find this post useful when thinking about what the process might be like for them or their students.
